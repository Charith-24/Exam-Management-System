# Exam-Management-System

Hello!ðŸ˜€
 Well, this is my first "python based project activity", a simple and a decent one.If you are looking for a sample ref. for your school(11th/12thGrade) activity,then here you are.

A school project where I've been asked to create a Python Program for Exam Management.It includes functions like storing the details of students from different sections and streams, generating Merit List for various streams and generating a Report Card for each and every students who has registered and more.


# Certain requirements:

1)Install "Tabulate" module in the PythonScripts directory using the command ``` pip install tabulate```

2)Copy the folder _CSprojectmodules ,to your python Lib directory.

3)Make sure the files StudentFile.dat and ResultFile.dat are in the same directory as Exam Management.py
