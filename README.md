#Exam-Management-System

Hello Peeps!ðŸ˜€
Well, this is my first "python based project activity", a simple and a decent one.If you are looking for a sample ref. for your school(11th/12thGrade) activity,then here you are..




Certain requirements:

1)Install "Tabulate" module in the PythonScripts directory using the command pip install tabulate.

2)Copy the folder _CSprojectmodules ,to your python Lib directory.

3)Then make sure you copy ("Exam Management System(.py file), StudentFile(.dat file), Result(.dat file)),these files to _CSprojectmodules.
