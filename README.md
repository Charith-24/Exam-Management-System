# Exam-Management-System

Hello!
 Well, this is my first "python based project", a simple and a decent one.

My high-school project where I've been asked to create a Python Program 'Exam Management System' which works on functions like storing the details of students from different sections and streams, generating Merit List of various streams and generating Report Cards for each and every students who has registered and more.


# Certain requirements:

1)Install "Tabulate" module in the PythonScripts directory using the command ``` pip install tabulate```

2)Copy the folder _CSprojectmodules ,to your python Lib directory.

3)Make sure the files StudentFile.dat and ResultFile.dat are in the same directory as Exam Management.py
